- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
 tested each time the loop repeats
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
When the first set of instructions is executed again
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
first
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
it's executed once at the beginning of the loop
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
each time before the loop runs
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
before each iteration
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment
